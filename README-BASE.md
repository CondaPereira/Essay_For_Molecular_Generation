Inspired by YanZhe Zhang's [__papers_for_protein_design_using_DL__](https://github.com/Peldom/papers_for_protein_design_using_DL), I have a tendency to organize __drug discovery papers by deep learning__ published in recent years especially on __molecular generation__, and this repo in the future will always be dynamic.We will make this list by [Manubot](http://manubot.org), If you know some literature in this regard, I also very welcome you to put forward the __doi/url/arxiv/PMID__ and so on of the literature collected in this issue in the issue, On the other way, you can also __contribute__ by create or edit the file in the content directory, as follows is for example: 
```ruby
## Manubot example documention and introduction link
url:https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/ 
doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387 
url:https://github.com/manubot/manubot/ 
``` 
In this repository, `README.md` is created via continuous integration and should not be edited directly.
Edit `README-BASE.md` to update this text.
Update the reference lists in the `content` directory to add new sections or references.
This is only a proof of concept that is not robust against errors in the scripts or merge conflicts.

The `deploy.sh`, and `environment.yml` files were derived from <https://github.com/manubot/rootstock> (CC0 1.0 license).

If you are still confused with the markdown format about reasonable reference and In addition, this workflow only runs on issues with the label `reference`.
Please See [#7](https://github.com/agitter/manubot-awesome-list/issues/7) for an example:)
